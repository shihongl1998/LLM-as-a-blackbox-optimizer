## :open_file_folder: Prompt Inversion Function

One of the most exciting updates is the application of our method on *Prompt Inversion*! 

### What is Prompt Inversion?

Prompt inversion is a powerful feature that enables our system to reverse-engineer the prompts from their generated outputs. It has a wide array of applications, from debugging to enhancing user understanding of how our models work.

### Key Features:

- **GPT4-V:** set as the Black-box Evaluation Function of the pipeline in our paper
- **DALLÂ·E 3:** newest vision language model from OpenAI
